A compiler translates one programming language to another. The simplified compiler has the following structure:
\begin{compactitem}[$\quad\bullet$]
	\item Lexical Analysis: Source Code $\to$ Token Stream
	\item Parsing: Token Stream $\to$ AST
	\item Intermediate Code Generation: AST $\to$ Intermediate Code
	\item Code Generation: Intermediate Code $\to$ Target Code
\end{compactitem}

The first two steps are the frontend and machine independent, the last step is the backend and machine dependent.
